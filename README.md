This repository is filled with solutions to a number of different problems involving arrays using the Swift programming language. The probelms were taken from a number of resources including *Project Euler* and *Coding Bat*. If you are learing about arrays there are a number of good propbelms to test out in this repository, or to help you undertsand the **power** that arrays have!

1. **Problem 7** from *Project Euler* can be found [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7)

1. **Problem 10** from *Project Euler* can be found [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=10). *__Note__*: Running problem 10 currently takes a very long time, and has some lag issues. 

1. A collection of **Array-1** probelms from *Coding Bat* can be found [here](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-1), however not all of the solutions to **Array-1** can be found in this repository. 

1. In this repository there is also a file called *"12_09_hw.playground"* that contains a number of differnt array related sytax examples, and other small problems.
