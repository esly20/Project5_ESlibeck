This repository is filled with solutions to a number of differnt problems involving arrays using the Swift programming language. The probelms were taken from a number of resources including *Project Euler* and *Coding Bat*.

**Problem 7** from *Project Euler* can be found [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7)

A collection of **Array-1** probelms from *Coding Bat* can be found [here](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-1), however not all of the solutions to **Array-1** can be found in this repository. 


I submitted my senior page yesterday, and I went with the *Star Wars* page instead of the sentimental page because it was funnier and cooler, and also a total **Power Move**.
